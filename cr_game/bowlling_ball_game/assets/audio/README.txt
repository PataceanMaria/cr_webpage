Place a background music file here named:

music.mp3

Recommendations for a Romanian vibe:
- Use an instrumental folk motif (e.g., cimbalom, pan flute, violin) or a modern lo-fi beat with subtle Romanian folk elements.
- Keep it loop-friendly (trim clean loop points) and around 60–90 seconds.

Licensing:
- Only use music you own or that's royalty-free for your intended distribution.

After copying the file, run:
flutter pub get
flutter run
